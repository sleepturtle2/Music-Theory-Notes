**[Diminished Chords](https://www.fretjam.com/diminished-7th-chords.html):**

There are 3 kinds of Diminished Chords: 
- Diminished Triad (dim) - 1, b3, b5 
- Half Diminished (m7b5) - 1, b3, b5, b7
- Diminished 7th / Full Diminished (dim7) - 1, b3, b5, bb7 (dim7)


Diminished Triad Harmony is (1,b3,b5). Cdim would be C, Eb, Gb (1,b3,b5)

Half-Diminished Chords: (1,b3,b5,b7)
(Also known as a minor 7 flat 5 chord). So a C half diminished chord would have an added Bb note, ie, (C,Eb,Gb,Bb)

Full-Diminished or Diminished 7 Chords: (1,b3,b5,bb7) or (1,b3,b5,6)
Double flat 7th note means the 6th note of a major scale. Cdim7 has notes (C, Eb, Gb, A)

Full Dimished Chord Shapes Across the Fretboard: 

1. Root on the E string (Only in Cdim7 you can use open A string):

2. Root on A string

3. Root on D string:

**Where to Use Diminished chords?** 
Typically used as a transition/bridge chord. Examples:
- In progression of F    | G     | Am    |, try using F  F#dim| G G#dim| Am. This helps us create a chromatic effect. 

- In a I-IV-I progression, use IV#dim as a bridge chord before moving into I. ie, I - IV - IV#dim - I instead of just I-IV-I. 

- Similarly, in I-ii we can add I-bii dim7-ii. 

- In blues, it is used along with the I7 chord, ie, I7-Idim in the same bar, to add more effect 

- Of the 4 notes in a diminished chord, you can step up a semitone in any of those 4 tones, and move to resolution. So from one dim chord, we can have 4 resolutions. 

- We have these options for diminshed chords to use as bridge chords. One between I and ii can be used between vi and vii etc.

- Interesting fact about the diminished shape (applicable to all shapes ) is that when you slide it up 3 frets, you still get the same chords, just different order of notes. This happens due to the fact that each note of a diminished chord is separated from each other by a minor third interval, ie, 3 frets. This is called a symmetric chord (because every note can be used a a root)

Properties: 
- Every note is a minor third (3 half steps) apart. The chord repeats itself after every b3 interval (3 frets). dim7 chords in the same row are the same. 

    1   | 4  | 7   | 10            
    ----|----|-----|----
    C  | Eb | Gb  | A
    Db | E  | G   | Bb 
    D  | F  | Ab | B   

- **Resolution** - Resolves into both major and minor. So for every dim7 chord, we have 8 options to resolve it. 
For chords of a major scale, the 7th chord is a diminished triad, but in practice we can use the full dim 7 shape (with the added 6th) and use it to resolve to I. 

    A C<sup>o</sup> 7 can resolve into Db (I)  
In a minor scale, (i ii<sup>o</sup> III iv v VI VII) the second chord is a diminished chord. So a C<sup>o</sup> 7 (ii<sup>o</sup> chord for Bbm) would resolve into a Bbm (I). 

    In summary, we can **Resolve UP a 1/2 step to a major chord** or **Resolve DOWN a 1 step to a minor chord**.

    Now, since every dim7 chord has 4 inversions around its 4 base notes, every such chord can resolve to their respective major and minor tonal centres. For eg, <br>
    to resolve D<sup>o</sup> 7, containing notes D F Ab B, <br>
        D<sup>o</sup> 7-> Eb (UP a 1/2 step to a major chord)<br>
        D<sup>o</sup> 7 -> Cm (DOWN 1 step to a minor chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> F<sup>o</sup> 7 -> Gb (UP a 1/2 step to a major chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> F<sup>o</sup> 7 -> Ebm (DOWN a 1 step to a minor chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> Ab<sup>o</sup> 7 -> A (UP a 1/2 step to a major chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> Ab<sup>o</sup> 7 -> Gbm (DOWN a 1 step to a minor chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> B<sup>o</sup> 7 -> C (UP a 1/2 step to a major chord)<br>
    D<sup>o</sup> 7 <-> B<sup>o</sup> 7 -> Am (DOWN a 1 step to a minor chord)<br>
- Using the above relations, the dim7 chords can be used effectively to change keys in a song, using them as bridge chords


 
**Practice Progressions**: 
- Am | C6 | B half dim | E7 (Bossa Nova)
- C / F / C / Db dim7 / Dm / G 
- D9 | Eb full dim | A7 (blues progression in A)
