Diminished Chords:

Basic Diminished Harmony is (1,b3,b5). 
Chords are built from triads in the major scale. For eg, C scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), Cdim would be C, D#, F# (1,b3,b5)

Half-Diminished Chords: (1,b3,b5,b7)
(Also known as a minor 7 flat 5 chord). So a C half diminished chord would have an added Bb note, ie, (C,D#,F,Bb)
