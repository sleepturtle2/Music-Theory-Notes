**Diminished Chords:**

Basic Diminished Triad Harmony is (1,b3,b5). 
Chords are built from triads in the major scale. For eg, C scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), Cdim would be C, D#, F# (1,b3,b5)

Half-Diminished Chords: (1,b3,b5,b7)
(Also known as a minor 7 flat 5 chord). So a C half diminished chord would have an added Bb note, ie, (C,D#,F,Bb)

Full-Diminished Chords: (1,b3,b5,bb7) or (1,b3,b5,6)
Double flat 7th note means the 6th note of a major scale.

**Where to Use Diminished chords?** 
Typically used as a transition/bridge chord. Examples:
- In progression of F    | G     | Am    |, try using F  F#dim| G G#dim| Am. This helps us create a chromatic effect. 

- In a I-IV-I progression, use IV#dim as a bridge chord before moving into I. ie, I - IV - IV#dim - I instead of just I-IV-I. 

- Similarly, in I-ii we can add I-bii dim7-ii. 

- In blues, it is used along with the I7 chord, ie, I7-Idim in the same bar, to add more effect 

- Of the 4 notes in a diminished chord, you can step up a semitone in any of those 4 tones, and move to resolution. So from one dim chord, we can have 4 resolutions. 

- We have these options for diminshed chords to use as bridge chords. One between I and ii can be used between vi and vii etc.

- Interesting fact about the diminished shape (applicable to all shapes ) is that when you slide it up 3 frets, you still get the same chords, just different order of notes. This happens due to the fact that each note of a diminished chord is separated from each other by a minor third interval, ie, 3 frets. 

**Practice Progressions**: 
- Am | C6 | B half dim | E7 (Bossa Nova)
- C / F / C / Db dim7 / Dm / G 
- D9 | Eb full dim | A7 (blues progression in A)
