MAJOR SCALE CHORDS â€“ SEVENTHS
We can create 4 note chords that we label sevenths chords. The formula for sevenths chords in the major scale is:

I =   Major 7
ii =  Minor 7
iii = Minor 7
IV =  Major 7
V =   Dominant 7
vi =  Minor 7
vii = Half Diminished
These chords are further explained in our article on sevenths chords. These chords will add more colour to your playing. Make sure on the 5th chord of the scale you play a dominant 7. While all minor triad chords turn into minor 7, our major triads turn into major or dominant 7. Be aware of what chord is the 5th from your chosen major scale.
