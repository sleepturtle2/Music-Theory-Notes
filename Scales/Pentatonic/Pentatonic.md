The idea in both the pentatonics is to remove half-step intervals from the scale. In major, these are 4th and 7th. In minor, these are 2nd and 6th. 

Thus, the major scale and its relative minor will have the exact same notes. C major pentatonic = A minor pentatonic. 

**Major Pentatonic**

In Pentatonic Scale, the 4th(perfect 4th) and 7th(major 7th) intervals are not there. 

C major -> C D E F G A B C 
C major pent -> C D E G A C 


**Minor Pentatonic**
Relative minor is Am. 
A minor -> A B C D E F G A 
Am pent -> A C D E G A 

Pentatonic scale doesnt contain any semi-tones. 4th is a half-step rise from 3rd, 7th is a half-step fall from root. 

**Caged Pentatonics**
(Reusable Open Shapes -- 
    Major - C, G
    Minor - A, E
)
C major Pent = A minor Pent in the C major / Am Open Shape (exclude 4th = F, 7th = B)
