Section 1 - D major , I-IV-V-I  (D-A-G-D)
 - C note, or minor seventh during 'basant kuhu' gives a minor flavour
 - The harmony gives a altering happy-sad feeling 
 - The harmony lines are on two different notes 


Section 2 - E harmonic minor (Em - Am - B/B7)
- Choice of scale: 
    - a shift to a minor scale was needed. E harmonic minor was a good choice because of some already common chords -- Em (ii of D), F#m in D (iii of D) F#dim in E (ii of E harm m), G(IV of D) Gaug in E, A in D (V); Am in E, Bm in D; B in E. 
    - the similar chords can be used as bridge chords. the different chords bring out the flavour of the new scale 

- Transition
  - D - D# - Em. Since Em is already in key of D, even if you shifted to Em without the D#, it would still sound like D. So it was needed to reset the tonal center to E. 

- The harmony lines are on the same note, different octaves. The melody is more focused and definitive. 

Section 3 - A major (A-D-E) (I-IV-V)
- Transition
  - Em to E makes a very distinct minor to major shift. E is the V of A. Then move to A-D-E. 
- Happy major-only section

Section 4 - A major (F#m-C#m-Bm) (vi-iii-ii)
- Transition - Abrupt shift into Bm and F#m. Shift does not feel smooth. I dont know if that is intended.
